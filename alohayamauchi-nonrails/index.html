                                My name is Jared Yamauchi. I was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii. As a media designer, I grew up enjoying painting and drawing since elementary school to high school. During early year 2000s, the computer technology started to grow before MySpace and Facebook had been established and that is when I became attracted to digital designs.

                                <h4>Web Development</h4>
                                I love designing and creating websites! I can do front-end and back-end development as I should be able to create from scratch.

                                <h4>Media Designing</h4>
                                Designing is my childhood passion where I grew up drawing and painting. I love to design with Photoshop and Illustrator and even doing 3D modeling. It is great for front-ending web development so that I can integrate my designing skills to the websites.

                                Since I graduated from Gallaudet University with Government degree, I am interested in debating about politics and government involvments. From my experiences working at US Congress, White House Correspondence OFfice, and Hawaii State Capitol, I could be able to work for almost any governmental agency.
