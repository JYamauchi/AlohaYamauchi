                        My name is Jared Yamauchi. I was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii. As a media designer, I grew up enjoying painting and drawing since elementary school to high school. During early year 2000s, the computer technology started to grow before MySpace and Facebook had been established and that is when I became attracted to digital designs.
